            <p>Welcome to our platform!</p>
            <p>Please follow these instructions:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Maintain a Healthy Weight: Being overweight or obese significantly increases your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Aim for a body mass index (BMI) within the healthy range (18.5 to 24.9). Consult with a healthcare provider to determine a healthy weight goal for you.</li>
                <li>Follow a Balanced Diet: Consume a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Limit your intake of processed foods, sugary beverages, refined carbohydrates, and foods high in saturated and trans fats. Focus on portion control and moderation.</li>
                <li>Control Carbohydrate Intake: Monitor your carbohydrate consumption, particularly refined carbohydrates like white bread, white rice, and sugary snacks. Opt for complex carbohydrates that are high in fiber and have a lower impact on blood sugar levels, such as whole grains, legumes, and vegetables.</li>
                <li>Stay Hydrated: Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Limit the intake of sugary drinks like soda, fruit juices, and energy drinks, as they can contribute to weight gain and increase the risk of diabetes.</li>
                <li>Exercise Regularly: Engage in regular activity to help control weight, improve insulin sensitivity. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise per week, along with muscle-strengthening activities on two or more days per week.</li>
                <li>Monitor Blood Sugar Levels: If you have prediabetes or are at risk of developing diabetes due to family history or other factors, monitor your blood sugar levels regularly. This can help you detect any changes early and take preventive measures.</li>
                <li>Quit Smoking: Smoking increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and complicates its management. If you smoke, seek support and resources to quit smoking.</li>
                <li>Get Regular Check-ups: Schedule regular check-ups with your healthcare provider to monitor your overall health, including blood sugar levels, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other risk factors for diabetes.</li>
                <li>Manage Stress: Chronic stress can contribute to unhealthy lifestyle habits and increase the risk of developing diabetes. Practice stress-reducing techniques such as mindfulness, meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises.</li>
                <li>Get enough sleep: Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep each night.</li>
